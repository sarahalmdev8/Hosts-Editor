# Hosts-Editor

Multi-platform Hosts file editor written in Java with JavaFX UI.

Remember to run this as administrator. Native packaging is still pending.
I will try to figure out the elevation on launch if possible.


For Unix-like systems:
```
sudo java -jar hosts-editor.jar
```

For Windows:

```
runas /user:administrator java -jar hosts-editor.jar
```
